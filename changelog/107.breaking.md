Removed (the mostly internal interfaces) [`input4mips_validation.logging_config.serialise_logging_config`][input4mips_validation.logging_config.serialise_logging_config] and [`input4mips_validation.logging_config.deserialise_logging_config`][input4mips_validation.logging_config.deserialise_logging_config].
We don't think these are in general need, although it is still being figured out (see [#108](https://github.com/climate-resource/input4mips_validation/issues/108)).
