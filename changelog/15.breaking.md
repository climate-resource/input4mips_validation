Completely re-wrote the package in an attempt to better handle the controlled vocabularies (CVs).

The key module is still {py:mod}`input4mips_validation.dataset`.

However, we now also have {py:mod}`input4mips_validation.cvs_handling`, which we use for sanely handling the CVs.
This package may be split out into a separate package in future.
