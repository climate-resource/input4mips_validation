- Added `--version` flag to the `input4mips-validation` command

- Added `--no-logging` to the `input4mips-validation` command to disable logging
- Added `--logging-config` to the `input4mips-validation` command to allow the user to specify the path to the logging configuration file
- Added `--logging-level` to the `input4mips-validation` command to allow the user to simply specify the logging level to use. Note that `--logging-config` takes precedence over this flag.

- Fixed up the logging levels throughout the CLI and associated commands

- Added the [`Input4MIPsDataset.non_input4mips_metadata`][input4mips_validation.dataset.Input4MIPsDataset.non_input4mips_metadata]
  attribute to handle metadata that is not part of the known input4MIPs keys
- Added [`Input4MIPsDataset.from_ds`][input4mips_validation.dataset.Input4MIPsDataset.from_ds]
  to allow easy creation from a loaded [xarray.Dataset][]

- Added the `--rglob-input` option to better control files of interest.
  This appplies to both `input4mips-validation validate-tree`
  and `input4mips-validation create-db`
