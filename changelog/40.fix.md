- Fixed a bug in the behaviour of `input4mips-validation validate-file`'s `--write-in-drs` flag.
  If this flag is used, this command now fixes file names too
  and will update the tracking ID and creation ID
  if anything about the file (including its name) is changed.
  The command now also raises an error if you try overwrite an existing file.
- Removed the product and region properties from the minimum dataset producer metadata related classes
