- Fixed a bug in the behaviour of `input4mips-validation validate-file`'s `--write-in-drs` flag.
  If this flag is used, this command now fixes file names too
  and will update the tracking ID and creation ID
  if anything about the file (including its name) is changed.
  The command now also raises an error if you try overwrite an existing file.
- Removed the product and region properties from the minimum dataset producer metadata related classes
- Replaced all uses of [xarray.load_dataset][] with [xarray.open_dataset][].
  The latter doesn't load the file's data into memory, hence is much faster
  (especially for large files).
- Fixed the behaviour of [`Input4MIPsDatabaseEntryFile.from_file`][input4mips_validation.database.database.Input4MIPsDatabaseEntryFile.from_file].
  Now, if there is a clash between metadata, a warning is logged
  but the existing value is used
  (i.e. the value from higher-priority sources is used)
  rather than an error being raised.
