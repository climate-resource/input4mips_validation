- Added support for fields used by input4MIPs database:
    - comment
    - comment_post_publication
    - data_node
    - esgf_dataset_master_id
    - filepath
    - latest
    - publication_status
    - replica
    - sha256
    - timestamp
    - validated_input4mips
    - xlink

- Made all metadata-related classes frozen so they can be hashed,
  which makes sorting and comparison easier
  (and has almost no downsides
  as these classes do not generally need to be changed once created,
  and if they do need to be changed, that can be done with [attrs.evolve][]).
