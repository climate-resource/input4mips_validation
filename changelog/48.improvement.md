[loguru-config](https://github.com/erezinman/loguru-config)
is now an optional dependency.
This makes it possible to install the package from conda
without things exploding, as loguru-config is not available on conda.
This may be changed in future, if loguru-config is released on conda
(relevant MR here: https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/27110)
