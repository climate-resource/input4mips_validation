- Removed the `--create-db-entry` flag from the `validate-file` command.
  Use the newly added `input4mips-validation db` commands to control the database instead.
- Our databases our now multi-file, one file per file entry. This makes it much easier to track changes to the database.
  To load a database from a directory of files, use [`load_database_file_entries`][input4mips_validation.database.database.load_database_file_entries]
