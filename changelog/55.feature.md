- Added `input4mips-validation db` command group for handling database creation and manipulation.
  This includes:

  - `input4mips-validation db create` for creating new databases
  - `input4mips-validation db add-tree` for adding files from a tree to an existing databases
  - `input4mips-validation db validate` for updating the validation status of the entries in a database

- Added [`input4mips_validation.validation.database`][input4mips_validation.validation.database] for database validation

- Added [`input4mips_validation.logging_config`][input4mips_validation.logging_config]
  to support passing of logging configuration between parallel processes.
  We're not sure if this is a great solution.
  If you have another solution, PRs welcome!
