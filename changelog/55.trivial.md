- Made the conda recipe pin printing script also print the files without the pins,
  so it's easier to make sure we include all dependencies in the conda recipe
  (in other words, we can just direct copy-paste the non-locked dependences too now).
- Split [`input4mips_validation.cli`][input4mips_validation.cli] into sub-modules.
  This made it easier to add the `db` sub-group
  and to share options across different command groups.
- Split the [`input4mips_validation.validation`][input4mips_validation.validation] module into sub-modules.
  This makes it easier to share functionality and understand how it works.
- Renamed `scripts/create-test-cvs.py` -> `scripts/write-test-cvs.py` for consistency with other scripts
