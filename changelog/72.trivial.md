Updated a number of internal set up bits and pieces, e.g.:

- removing the mention of poetry from the bug issue template
- updating the CI workflows
- using an environment for deploying to PyPI
- updating the `Makefile`
- updating the docs to use a `NAVIGATION.md` file with literate-nav
- fixing all the pull request links in the CHANGELOG in the docs
- simplifying the auto-generated docs
