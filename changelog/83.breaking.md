Updated to better be in line with [the DRS description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0r8RZr_f3-8egBMMh7aqLwy3snpD6_MrDz1q8n5XUk).
The DRS makes no comment on the values in the directory names,
hence we now make no assumptions and put no requirements on characters used in directory names.
The restriction to only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the hyphen plus special use of the underscore
is now only applied to file names.
As a result, files with variables that have underscores in their names
are now written with underscores in their directories, but not in their file name.
For example,
`.../mon/mole-fraction-of-methane-in-air/gn/.../mole-fraction-of-methane-in-air_input4MIPs_GHGConcentrations_CMIP_CR-CMIP-0-2-0_gn_200001-201012.nc`
is now written as
`.../mon/mole_fraction_of_methane_in_air/gn/.../mole-fraction-of-methane-in-air_input4MIPs_GHGConcentrations_CMIP_CR-CMIP-0-2-0_gn_200001-201012.nc`.
