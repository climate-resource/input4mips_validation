Renamed `bnds_coord_indicator` to `bnds_coord_indicators` throughout.
This breaks the API, albeit it is a rarely used part of the API
and the defaults are sensible.
Wherever `bnds_coord_indicator` was used, it now needs to be replaced with a set of strings, e.g. `{"bnds"}`.
If using the command-line option, then `--bnds-coord-indicator 'bnds'`
would be replaced with `--bnds-coord-indicators 'bnds'`
and there is now also the possibility to provide multiple values
with e.g. `--bnds-coord-indicators 'bnds;bounds'`.
