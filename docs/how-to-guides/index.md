This part of the project documentation
will focus on a **problem-oriented** approach.
We'll go over how to solve common tasks.

## How to validate a file and write it into the DRS?

Coming soon :)

- validate single file
- write it into DRS

## How to validate a tree of files?

Coming soon :)

- validate the tree of files
- assumes the files follow the DRS

## How to create a database from a tree of files?

Coming soon :)

- recommend validating first (cross-ref)
- rolls over the files, creates database entry for each
- writes out the database
  (currently as JSON, whether that's smart or not is a different question)
